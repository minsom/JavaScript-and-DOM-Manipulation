[step#1] Automaic Table
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to an index.html web page and then added new rows of data(@static/js/data.js) for each UFO sighting.

[step#2] Multiple Search
* Using 4 multiple `input` tags and a select dropdown, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  1. `date/time`->input
  2. `city`->input
  3. `state`->input
  4. `country`->input
  5. `shape`->select(dropdown)
